	abstract = {The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is the
	            elliptic curve analogue of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).
	            It was accepted in 1999 as an ANSI standard and in 2000 as IEEE
	            and NIST standards. It was also accepted in 1998 as an ISO
	            standard and is under consideration for inclusion in some other
	            ISO standards. Unlike the ordinary discrete logarithm problem and
	            the integer factorization problem, no subexponential-time
	            algorithm is known for the elliptic curve discrete logarithm
	            problem. For this reason, the strength-per-key-bit is
	            substantially greater in an algorithm that uses elliptic curves.
	            This paper describes the ANSI X9.62 ECDSA, and discusses related
	            security, implementation, and interoperability issues.},
